# CMOS_Battery_PCB_CR2032

Allows a safer CR2032 battery backed clock/CMOS RAM alternative to Varta PCB mounted solution.

Can be used with existing PCB charging circuitry as it includes a blocking diode. This board will NOT charge the coin cell.

PCB is designed to be mounted separately from main PCB, with flying leads providing power to PCB battery socket.


This board has so far been tested on machines equipped with the Philips PCF8583T chip.
